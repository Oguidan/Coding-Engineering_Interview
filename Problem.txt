Here is the problem,
I will give you a collection of numbers and I need you to take this collection of number and find a matching pair that is equal to a sum that I give as well.
Example the collection could be: 
[1, 2, 3, 9] sum 8
[1, 2, 4, 4] sum 8
and the sum is 8.
These bumbers are given in memory you can go with an array you can also assume that they're ordered intending. You can't repeat the same element at the same index twice but certainly the same number may appear twice. The bumbers can be negatives. The numbers are not sorted.
